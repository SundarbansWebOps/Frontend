This open mic is a chance for poets of all languages to share their passion. 

As Dinkar Ji beautifully expressed:
"शक्ति और क्षमा दोनों हैं प्रेम के ही दो रूप,"
let us reflect on these sentiments as we create and share together.

Looking forward to your presence!

Let your creativity flow with us as we bring poetry to life! 📜🎤
